From fact extractor:
- working with n-grams at the matching level will make it more versatile
- working with the DEP tree structure and using things like the compound DEP_ value will probably be a lot more useful
- things like quotes may require their own rules
- adding token matching to the fact extractor pattern matcher is a good idea
- separating the pattern matching from the fact extractor is a good idea

idea:
- what if you could add an average of images of sorts for each word in the word profiles database
